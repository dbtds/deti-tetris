DETI-Tetris
===========
This project was created to check the possibility to play Tetris with a Kinect.

Since that this project was an experiment with Tetris and Kinect, there's no deployment files or instructions.
It might have been an experiment but this game is pretty playable using gestures in front of the Kinect.

It was implemented using Visual Studio 2010 using Kinect SDK.
If you want to check the result of this project, all you need to do is install Visual Studio 2010 (or higher) and run the project.
